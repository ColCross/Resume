\item Implementing front end features in React for an embeddable video player for the Video Affiliate Network (VAN).
\item Writing cloud native services through AWS Lambda and the Serverless framework for distributed data processing using Node, SNS, DynamoDB, and RabbitMQ.
\item Designing features and requirements alongside technical and functional team members, including architecture and testing strategies.
\item Working directly with QA to find and resolve defects in features.
\item Employing full Agile methodologies through daily scrums, N+1's, grooming sessions, sprint retros, and Rally.
\item Developed minor features using ASP.NET, C\#, and Solr for the Resource application.

\section{Notable Contributions}
\runsubsection{VAN Ingestion Pipeline}
\location{| CNN Newsource}
Rebuilt the legacy VAN Video ingestion pipeline to include determining requirements and designing architecture. Transitioned Batchfeed from a serial processing ASP.NET application to a cloud native and fault tolerant distributed processing pipeline. Reduced processing time of videos from about 30 mins to 5 mins. Wrote a custom concurrency limited data migration script to bring legacy videos into the new system.
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{VAN Video Player}
\location{| CNN Newsource}
Built several front end components including loading animations, custom overlays, and a dynamic tooltip that constantly adjusts based on the parent page. Minimal libraries were used in order to keep player file size small and quick to load.
